When building a Success Plan, it is **critical** to use GitHub Fiscal Year notation for ALL dates and timelines. This is a mandatory requirement — never use calendar year quarters (Q1 CY26, Q1 2026, etc.).

## GitHub Fiscal Year Calendar

GitHub follows Microsoft's fiscal year (FY). The fiscal year **starts in July** and **ends in June**.

| Fiscal Quarter | Calendar Months | FY26 Example | FY27 Example |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Q1** | July – September | Q1 FY26 = Jul–Sep 2025 | Q1 FY27 = Jul–Sep 2026 |
| **Q2** | October – December | Q2 FY26 = Oct–Dec 2025 | Q2 FY27 = Oct–Dec 2026 |
| **Q3** | January – March | Q3 FY26 = Jan–Mar 2026 | Q3 FY27 = Jan–Mar 2027 |
| **Q4** | April – June | Q4 FY26 = Apr–Jun 2026 | Q4 FY27 = Apr–Jun 2027 |

## How to Determine the Current Fiscal Quarter

1. Check today's date
2. Find which calendar month range it falls in from the table above
3. Use the corresponding fiscal quarter and fiscal year

**Examples:**
- February 2026 → **Q3 FY26** (Jan–Mar 2026)
- May 2026 → **Q4 FY26** (Apr–Jun 2026)
- August 2026 → **Q1 FY27** (Jul–Sep 2026)
- November 2026 → **Q2 FY27** (Oct–Dec 2026)

## Date Rules for Success Plans

### ❌ NEVER use these formats:
- "Q1 2026" or "Q1 CY26" — this is calendar year notation
- "by end of 2026" — too vague, not fiscal-aligned
- "within 6 months" — use a specific fiscal quarter instead

### ✅ ALWAYS use these formats:
- **Fiscal quarters:** "by end of Q3 FY26", "Q4 FY26", "Q1 FY27"
- **Specific calendar dates with fiscal context:** "Late March 2026", "February 2026"
- **Ongoing/recurring:** "Ongoing", "Quarterly cadence", "Monthly"
- **Fiscal halves for major milestones:** H1 = Q1+Q2, H2 = Q3+Q4

### Key Activities MUST include dates

Every Key Activity should have a target date or timeframe. Use this hierarchy:
1. **Specific month** for near-term commitments from meeting notes (e.g., "Late Feb 2026", "March 2026")
2. **Fiscal quarter** for mid-term goals (e.g., "Q4 FY26", "Q1 FY27")
3. **"Ongoing"** or **"Quarterly cadence"** for recurring activities
4. If truly unknown, note why (e.g., "TBD pending customer response")

### Goals MUST include fiscal year timelines

Every goal that has a measurable target should include when that target should be achieved, using fiscal year notation.

**Good example:** "Increase engaged user rate from 40% to 60% by Q2 FY27"
**Bad example:** "Increase engaged user rate from 40% to 60% by end of 2026"
