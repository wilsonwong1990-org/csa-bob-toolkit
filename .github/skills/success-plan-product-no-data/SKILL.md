## Handling Products with No Data

**CRITICAL RULE:** The approach depends on whether the customer **owns the product** or **doesn't have it**.

### Scenario 1: Customer OWNS the product but usage is low/unknown

This IS actionable data. Create goals focused on:
- Understanding blockers to adoption
- Establishing baseline metrics
- Defining an activation path

**Approach:**
- Priority CTA: Product Kick-off or Metrics/Usage Insights to understand current state
- Set realistic incremental targets (e.g., +15-30% from baseline). Use provided metrics to help build realistic targets. 
- If unsure, provide a disclaimer and justification on what could cause a miss on the CTA/goal
- Focus on activation milestones with measurable outcomes
- If there are no solid measureable outcomes, set discovery discussions or ways to get measureable goals in the future

```markdown
## [Product] Measurable Goals

**Goal:** Understand current [Product] adoption state and identify blockers to activation.

**Baseline:**
- Seats purchased/bundled: [X]
- Seats consumed: [X] ([X]% utilization)

**Target:**
- Utilization: [Baseline + 20]% by [Timeline]
- Feature enablement: [X]% of priority repos/users by [Timeline]

**Recommended Action:** [Discovery action - e.g., establish baseline, identify blockers]

**CTAs:**
- [Relevant kick-off or discovery CTA]

**Note:** Targets are preliminary. Adjust after discovery confirms scope and blockers.
```

### Scenario 2: Customer DOES NOT have the product (no entitlement, using competitor)

**Do NOT create goals.** Instead:
- Note known competitor tooling
- State "No action required" or "Monitor for interest"
- Only add CTAs if the customer expresses interest

```markdown
## [Product] Measurable Goals

No [Product] entitlement for this account.

**Known Tooling:** [e.g., "Customer uses Snyk/Jenkins/Cursor/etc." or "Unknown"]

**Recommended Action:** No action required. Monitor for interest.
```

### What NOT to Do:
- ❌ Create arbitrary targets like "60% engagement by Q2" with no baseline
- ❌ Add CTAs for products the customer doesn't own or care about
- ❌ Fill sections with generic goals just to have content
- ❌ Assume the customer wants every GitHub product
- ❌ Treat "owns but not using" the same as "doesn't have the product
