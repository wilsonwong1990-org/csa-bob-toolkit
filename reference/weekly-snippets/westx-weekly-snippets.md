Snippets - A Guide
This is what good looks like! This document can be shared widely.

Why Snippets? They are a digestible format to share information with one another and with leadership. They are a quick pulse on the business, weekly, to make sure we are quickly identifying opportunities and trends, addressing risks, and working on the most important issues. Snippets are also an opportunity to celebrate great work and the contributions of your peers across GitHub.
Snippet structure: 
- Should be 1-3 sentences, max
- Should be consumable by someone with limited context on the topic - write simply and clearly, in plain language, and re-read to ensure that it will be comprehensible to a wide audience. 
- Limit use of acronyms to those you would expect to be understood by nearly all Revenue Hubbers
- Do not use project names (i.e., Project Abba) without a brief description of the project for context
 - Please follow the structure below:

Topics
Meaning
Key Decisions
What did we/you decide during the week that impacted the business?

Template: “Decision made by <person, team> to <start, stop, change something> . This impacts <the business in these ways>.

Example: 
Decision made with @tompost to ensure EBRs that carry a dual Corp and Ent SAL responsibility have a minimum enterprise threshold built into their comp plans for H2. This will help ensure behaviors are aligned to the outcomes we want to drive and that we have more equitable pipeline creation across the Corp and Ent teams.
Example: 
Decision made by the MSFT GTM and CAM teams to pilot the GitHub Landing Framework approach with a few partners to see if it is effective in helping identify and manage opportunities. Avanade UK was the first partner to have a GHLF planning session and we quickly identified @ 15 qualified MSFT co-sell opportunities for collaboration in just this one territory.
Example:
Decision made to proceed with +3 GHAS ASE headcount and 5 total Actions specialists for Enterprise. The ASE headcount will support the overall increased demands on the ASE team as GHAzDO approaches public preview and GA.
Metrics/Insights
What are you learning/noticing about the business?

Template: “Insight: we are seeing a trend of <a thing happening>. Examples include <X, Y>. Flagging this because <it has this impact on the business>.”

Example: 
Insight: we are continuing to see GitGuardian be aggressive in AMER accounts. We've had competitive pressure at CapitalOne, Moodys, Alberstons, AMD, Xilinx, and Zup (subsidiary of ITAU). Our goal is to shift the focus to the value of SAST/SCA but continue to lean on secret scanning only deals in some accounts as a last resort.
Insight: Actions usage has begun growing rapidly in key SLG accounts. Outside of Massachusetts, we are now seeing growth in strategic accounts such as NYS ITS as result of services engagements. In addition to these large movers, we're seeing initial appetite growing among some of our most engaged current customers (TN, OK, CA ABC, CCSF).
Template: “Metric: <X% of Y> happened in <time frame>. This demonstrates <growth, contraction> and <has this impact on the business.>

Example: 
Metric: We started 236 GHAS trials in Q4 of FY22 (up from 168 in Q4 of FY21), resulting in a 40.48% increase in activity. Globally, we won 58.1% of all trials started and concluded in Q4 of FY22. In Q4 of FY21, we won 43% of all trials started and concluded in the quarter, meaning we are up 15.1% YoY.
Metric: we’ve identified $590k of TAM opportunity in the mid-market/corp accounts on the MSFT CSU scorecard. The Corporate Solutions Sales (CSS) team has kicked off Project Abba, a pilot w/ corp sellers, services & sales dev, to identify where we can apply Unified credits to support customer activation and adoption with professional services. 


Topics for Discussion/Risks
Things you want people to be aware about or give a heads up on

Template: “For discussion: can we consider <new idea> for <this timeframe>? This would drive <this outcome for the business>. 

Example: 
Discussion: should we consider a standalone metered billing bucket for FY23 compensation? It would provide increased focus on Actions motions.
Discussion: are we providing new hires the most inclusive and accessible onboarding experience? A new Hubber shared with me that the amount of reading required in the early weeks was overwhelming in general, but particularly challenging for this candidate based on a learning difference. Could we consider more videos or synchronous learning options long term?

Template: “Risk: <this pattern, threat, issue> presents risk to the business <in these ways>. I recommend we do <these things> to mitigate.”

Example:
Risk: As more customers migrate and increase their utilization of GHEC, we are seeing an increasing number of customers being impacted by API rate limits. We created an API Rate Limit Impact Doc outlining customer examples and recommendations for improvements.
Up Next
Key focus areas for the upcoming week

Template: “Next week: focus on <this tangible deliverable, outcome or project>. 

Example: 
Next week, I’m finishing the last Reflection conversations; all will be completed by 12/20.
Example: 
Next week, I will finalize and ship the deck supporting the MSFT joint GTM review. That meeting is scheduled for 1/12/23.


Celebration
Shout out to a team or individual! 

Example: 
We had a very good GES LT / Customer Success LT global leadership quarterly call this week to discuss priorities, trends, needs, etc. Kudos to the CS team for solid preparation and a very robust discussion.
Example: 
Connor Douglass, Corporate Solutions Specialist (Fink's team) is the first of the MSFT GTM group to pass the AZ900 exam! 🎉 He also put together a quick study guide which is a helpful resource on Azure basics.
